If you get an error saying "No module named 'requests'" when you try to run a Python script that uses the requests library, it means that the requests library is not installed on your system.
if you get an error saying "Unresolved reference 'bs4'" when you try to run a Python script that uses the BeautifulSoup library, it means that the bs4 (Beautiful Soup 4) library is not installed on your system.
